  ## Usage  
  Once the user has navigated to the Workout Tracker, they may input pertinent data through the relevant input fields provided. By selecting resistance, the user may input the name of exercise performed as well as list weight amount and number of sets and reps. By selecting cardio, the user may input the type of exercise along with the distance covered. Both exercise types provide a duration field to track the amount of time spent performing the activity. Once the exercise has been added, the dashboard may be used to see the collected data displayed in various graph forms. As it stands currently, the dashboard is tracking the past seven days worth of exercises.
